HÃ¶ckis, Eiman och Koen.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped me with
my work over the last couple of months: Thanks to everyone in the SBR/SBC team
at Amadeus: Gilles, Luis, Olivier, Ivano and Valerie. Many thanks to my
supervisor Bruno, who has been an invaluable mainstay throughout the project.
\\\\
I would also like to thank my dear friend Martin Andersson for helping me
accommodate to a life in France. Thanks also for teaching me how to appreciate
the, somewhat different, French way of doing things.
