HÃ¶ckis, Eiman och Koen.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has helped me with
my work over the last couple of months: Thanks to everyone in the SBR/SBC team
at Amadeus: Gilles, Luis, Olivier, Ivano and Valerie. Many thanks to my
supervisor Bruno, who has been an invaluable mainstay throughout the project.
\\\\
I would also like to thank my dear friend Martin Andersson for helping me
accommodate to a life in France. Thanks also for teaching me how to appreciate
the, somewhat different, French way of doing things.

\chapter{Ethical Considerations}
<gres> jag hade skrivit ngt i stil med "ethical aspects: as the study design does not involve human subjects, environmental impact, etc, it does not require any particular ethical considerations"

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background}

Computer systems can be generalized to be composed of two things: data, and code operating on said data.  In order to
perform useful calculations, real-world applications accept user data which often varies in size.  To accomodate the
differences, memory is requested dynamically, at runtime, using a memory allocator. 

- malloc, free.
    - in turn asks underlying OS, mmap and/or sbrk.
        - difference depending on operating system
    - always does memory mapping in the end.

\section{Challenges}

- long-running applications
- threading
- terminology, 

- different methods for solving: speed, frag, thread perf
- jemalloc
- dlmalloc
- garbage collectors

- fragmentation: problem?

\section{Hypothesis}

- rmmalloc
- main goal
- choices
- why not, in the end (large per-block structures -- too big overhead)
